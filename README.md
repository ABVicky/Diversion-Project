<p id="description">We aim to develop a robust face recognition system for automated student attendance management. Our objectives: Efficient Data Management: Store comprehensive student data including face Email ID roll number name phone number section and branch in a centralized database. Automated Attendance Tracking: Utilize a camera to detect students' faces and match them with the database. Automatically generate a new MS Excel sheet with the names roll numbers and attendance status (present/absent). Real-time Attendance Updates: Auto-fill Excel sheets in real-time during the class. Delay saving the Excel file until 45 minutes after the class ends allowing for any attendance changes. Dynamic Attendance Recording: If face recognition fails automatically mark students as absent using their stored data. Handle brief student exits (e.g. 5 minutes) dynamically to avoid unnecessary absent marks. Period-wise Data Segmentation: Create a new Excel file automatically for each class period to organize attendance records. Student Accessibility: Provide students with the convenience of checking their attendance records on a dedicated website. By addressing these objectives the project aims to streamline attendance management eliminate manual errors and enhance overall efficiency in the academic environment.</p>
